The files in this directory extend the capabilities of the DataProvider API.
The Woodstock (sun) and Creator (rave) components make use of the
dataprovider APIs.

Data Provider APIs are part of Visual web Pack (also part of Java Studio
Creator). You can get the sources for the dataproviders from VisualWeb module
that is open sourced as a sub project on netbeans.org. You can either download
a source bundle or checkout the sources. Instructions are here:

    http://visualweb.netbeans.org/

Once you have the sources, you will find the data provider sources under:

    visualweb\dataprovider\runtime\library\src\com\sun\data\provider
