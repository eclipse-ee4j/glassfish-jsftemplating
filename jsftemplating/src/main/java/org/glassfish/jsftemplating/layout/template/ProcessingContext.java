/**
 *  <p> This interface defines the operations that may be acted upon while
 *      a "template" document is traversed.  The intent is that this
 *      interface may be implemented by the different "processing contexts"
 *      which occur throught the template file.  This provides the
 *      opportunity for context sensitive syntax in an easy to provide
 *      way.</p>
 *
 *  <p> While the standard <code>ProcessingContext</code> instances are
 *      likely to be sufficient, there may be cases where a custom
 *      <code>ProcessingContext</code> may be needed to process the
 *      children of a {@link CustomParserCommand}.  This may be done by
 *      implementing this interface, or extending one of the existing
 *      implementations.  Typically this object is used by passing it to
 *      the {@link TemplateReader#process(ProcessingContext, LayoutElement, boolean)}
 *      method -- this method will delegate actions back to the given
 *      <code>ProcessingContext</code>.</p>
