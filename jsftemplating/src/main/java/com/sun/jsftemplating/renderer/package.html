    <p>	This package provides a strategy for rendering complex components.  A
	complex component is any component that consists of multiple
	sub-components.  The {@link com.sun.jsftemplating.renderer.TemplateRenderer}
	is the actual Renderer class, the other files in this package provide
	support for creating and holding the LayoutDefinition information.
	While {@link com.sun.jsftemplating.renderer.TemplateRenderer} could also
	render a simple component, the flexibility and extensibility
	capabilities are probably overkill for small components.</p>

    <p>	The {@link com.sun.jsftemplating.renderer.TemplateRenderer}
	is driven off a "template".  The template is actually a tree data
	structure consisting of
	"{@link com.sun.jsftemplating.layout.descriptors.LayoutElement}"
	objects.  This structure is walked in order to render the component.
	This data structure may be populated programatically, however, a
	{@link com.sun.jsftemplating.layout.LayoutDefinitionManager}
	is the recommended way to obtain the structure.  A
	{@link com.sun.jsftemplating.layout.LayoutDefinitionManager}
	is responsible for locating a
	{@link com.sun.jsftemplating.layout.descriptors.LayoutDefinition} for a
	particular component (such as a table component).  How this is done is
	left to implementations of
	{@link com.sun.jsftemplating.layout.LayoutDefinitionManager}.  One
	implementation currently exists which populates the
	{@link com.sun.jsftemplating.layout.descriptors.LayoutElement}
	tree from an XML file:
	{@link com.sun.jsftemplating.layout.xml.XMLLayoutDefinitionManager}.</p>

    <p>	Different types of
	{@link com.sun.jsftemplating.layout.descriptors.LayoutElement} objects are
	used to effect the output.
	{@link com.sun.jsftemplating.layout.descriptors.LayoutElement}
	are delegated the encode responsibilty so that they may determine
	whether and how their child components are encoded.  See the
	{@link com.sun.jsftemplating.layout.descriptors.LayoutElement}
	documentation and the implementing classes of
	{@link com.sun.jsftemplating.layout.descriptors.LayoutElement}
	for more information.</p>
